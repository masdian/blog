My name is Riana Hadiana and I am a data lover. I love making beautiful charts, the statistical programming language R, soccer, futsal, Stephen Chow, Real Racing 3, FIFA mobile, and *something stupid* like I love you. I studied Statistics (formal) and Computer Science (non-formal), finishing my master in 2019. I live in Serang and Lampung, Indonesia, with my job and my family.
